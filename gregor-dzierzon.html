        <h3>I was born in East Germany</h3>
        <img src="images/germany.jpg" alt="Germany">
        <p>I love my German heritage and still love to go visit whenever I can. I have only been back to Germany a 
            few times but I would love to tour it more thoroughly and discover all of the amazing history.
        </p>

        <h3>I am a naturalized US Citizen</h3>
        <img src="images/usa.jpg" alt="USA">
        <p>We came to the US because of the freedoms that are available here. As much as I love Germany, I love that 
            I live here in the US, and that I can raise my family here.
        </p>

        <h3>Being a Grandpa is better than sliced bread</h3>
        <img src="images/sliced-bread.jpeg" alt="Sliced bread">
        <p>I have one grandson and he is my best buddy. I always heard that being a grandpa is amazing, but 
            I never thought it would be this cool. In May I get to also have a granddaughter!!! WOOHOO!!!
